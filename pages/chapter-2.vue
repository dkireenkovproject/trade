        <p class="chapter__descr">Since March, we plan to make purchases in South Africa.
Logistics from the Port of Cape Town to the port of St. Petersburg is 21 days.
Our company has financial resources for customs clearance, which is about 30% of the cost of the goods. We will do it ourselves.
The turnover cycle of the requested loan will be 30 days for the first delivery, from the day of loading until the moment of sale of the goods in European countries. For the second, third and subsequent deliveries, the turnover cycle will be 21 days.
A week from 18-20 containers per week in March, April and May. The cost of 1 invoice of Abbot pears will be $ 18-20,000. That is, the need per week in monetary terms will be $ 200-360,000. Consequently, per month $ 1,140,000.
The expected profit margin from each sale of a container, according to our forecasts, will be 5%. That is, with help. Our company plans to earn $1,512,000 from foreign trade activities with Egypt under a pessimistic scenario.
Under an optimistic scenario, the expected profit margin from each container sale will be 15%. Therefore, we plan to earn $1,311,000 per month.
Capital growth over 3 months by importing different varieties of pears (depending on the product category) under an optimistic scenario will be $171,000*3 c = $513,000.
In total, the total capital growth from imports from Egypt and South Africa under an optimistic scenario will be $649,000 from the bank's requested amount of $2,100,000 (960,000 for Egypt and $1,140,000 for South Africa) will be 30% in 5 months. South Africa has a long shelf life and does not spoil, does not lose quality and marketable appearance.
Since the interest rate on the loan is 13%, we are completely confident in the profitability and success of this business project.
South Africa from January to December, there is no interruption in supplies for this country
We will also make purchases in Iran, China and other countries
